# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Redux_Full_Tutorial
----

1. What is Redux?
   1.  Redux is a state manager package 

2. Why Redux?
   1. Typically in React we would have APP then we would have a component and sometimes we run a fetch for example to pull data into that component. Say we need that data to be accessessed elsewhere in our application. That would normally require us to lift the state back to the top level of our appication (if were not using Context in React) and then pass it back down via props.

3. Store
   1. Globalized State; Think of it as a seperate entity that your components can tap into

4. Action
   1. It describes what you want to do. Say for example we have an action that changes state on our app, maybe a counter that when a button is clicked this action increments by 1. This action would be increment

5. Reducer
    1. Describes how your actions transform your state into the next state
6. Dispatch
   1. Executes the action to the reducer. then the store gets updated.



### Setup the code
---

1. If you haven't already 
   1. npx create-react-app learn-redux
   2. npm install to install our dependencies
   3. npm install redux react-redux | both packages 
   4.
